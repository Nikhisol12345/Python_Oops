# Object-Oriented Programming in Python

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. OOP focuses on the data and how it is manipulated, rather than on the logic or the functions used to manipulate the data.

Python is an object-oriented programming language. It supports all the essential features of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

In this tutorial, you will learn about:

1. Classes and Objects
2. Inheritance
3. Polymorphism
4. Encapsulation

## Classes and Objects

In Python, a class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It is an abstract representation of the data and operations that will be associated with objects of that class.

An object is an instance of a class. It contains the data and the methods associated with the class. For example, if you were to create a class for a car, an object of that class might be a specific make and model of car.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a feature of OOP in which a class can inherit the methods
